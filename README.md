## Project definition

### Turborepo

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It was designed after the workflows used by massive software engineering organizations to ship code at scale. Turborepo abstracts the complex configuration needed for monorepos and provides fast, incremental builds with zero-configuration remote caching.

Using Turborepo simplifies managing your design system monorepo, as you can have a single lint, build, test, and release process for all packages. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software) about how monorepos improve your development workflow.

### Apps & Packages

This Turborepo includes the following packages and applications:

- `apps/docs`: Component documentation site with Storybook
- `examples`: Projects examples using the library
- `packages/components/<component-name>`: Component package
- `packages/components/lib`: UI Components library package
- `packages/core`: Core UI Features
- `packages/types`: Definitions of types
- `packages/utilities/<utility-name>`: Utility package
- `packages/tsconfig`: Shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the Turborepo
- `packages/eslint-config-custom`: ESLint preset
- `packages/jest-preset`: Jest preset
- `packages/prettier-config`: Prettier preset

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Workspaces enables us to "hoist" dependencies that are shared between packages to the root `package.json`. This means smaller `node_modules` folders and a better local dev experience. To install a dependency for the entire monorepo, use the `-w` workspaces flag with `pnpm add`.

This example sets up your `.gitignore` to exclude all generated files, other folders like `node_modules` used to store your dependencies.

### Compilation

To make the core library code work across all browsers, we need to compile the raw TypeScript and React code to plain JavaScript. We can accomplish this with `tsup`, which uses `esbuild` to greatly improve performance.

Running `pnpm build` from the root of the Turborepo will run the `build` command defined in each package's `package.json` file. Turborepo runs each `build` in parallel and caches & hashes the output to speed up future builds.

For `button`, the `build` command (`tsup`) use the component level setup:

```typescript
export default defineConfig((options) => ({
  entry: ['src/index.ts'],
  dts: true,
  sourcemap: false,
  clean: true,
  minify: !options.watch,
  format: ['cjs', 'esm'],
  target: 'es2020',
  tsconfig: 'tsconfig.json',
  external: ['react'],
  esbuildPlugins: [
    {
      name: 'css-module',
      setup(build): void {
        build.onResolve(
          { filter: /\.module\.css$/, namespace: 'file' },
          (args) => ({
            path: `${args.path}#css-module`,
            namespace: 'css-module',
            pluginData: {
              pathDir: path.join(args.resolveDir, args.path),
            },
          }),
        )
        build.onLoad(
          { filter: /#css-module$/, namespace: 'css-module' },
          async (args) => {
            const { pluginData } = args as {
              pluginData: { pathDir: string }
            }
            const source = await fsPromises.readFile(pluginData.pathDir, 'utf8')
            let cssModule = {}
            const result = await postcss([
              postcssModules({
                getJSON(_, json) {
                  cssModule = json
                },
              }),
            ]).process(source, { from: pluginData.pathDir })
            return {
              pluginData: { css: result.css },
              contents: `import "${
                pluginData.pathDir
              }"; export default ${JSON.stringify(cssModule)}`,
            }
          },
        )
        build.onResolve(
          { filter: /\.module\.css$/, namespace: 'css-module' },
          (args) => ({
            path: path.join(args.resolveDir, args.path, '#css-module-data'),
            namespace: 'css-module',
            pluginData: args.pluginData as { css: string },
          }),
        )
        build.onLoad(
          { filter: /#css-module-data$/, namespace: 'css-module' },
          (args) => ({
            contents: (args.pluginData as { css: string }).css,
            loader: 'css',
          }),
        )
      },
    },
  ],
}))
```

`tsup` compiles `src/index.tsx`, which exports all of the components in the design system, into both ES Modules and CommonJS formats as well as their TypeScript types. The `package.json` for `any package, e.g button` then instructs the consumer to select the correct format:

```json:button/package.json
{
  "name": "@plume-ui-react/button",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "module": "./dist/index.mjs",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "sideEffects": [
    "**/*.module.css"
  ],
  "license": "MIT",
  "files": [
    "dist/**"
  ],
}
```

Run `pnpm build` to confirm compilation is working correctly. You should see a folder `packages/components/button/dist` which contains the compiled output.

```bash
packages
  components
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ button
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dist
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css   <-- Styles
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.d.ts  <-- Types
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.d.mts  <-- Types ES  Module format
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js    <-- CommonJS version
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version
```

### Components

Each file inside of `packages/components` is a component inside our design system. For example:

```bash
  apps
    ...
  packages
    components
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ button
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spinner
  ...
```

### Storybook

Storybook provides us with an interactive UI playground for our components. This allows us to preview our components in the browser and instantly see changes when developing locally. This example preconfigures Storybook to:

- Use Vite to bundle stories instantly (in milliseconds)
- Automatically find any stories inside the `stories/` folder
- Write MDX for component documentation pages

For example, here's the included Story for our `Button` component:

```ts:apps/docs/stories/button.stories.tsx
import React from 'react'
import type { StoryObj, Meta } from '@storybook/react'
// others imports ...

/**
 * Enhance user interactions with the Button component,
 * featuring customizable styles for triggering actions within forms, dialogs, and other contexts.
 * With support for various sizes and states,
 * it facilitates actions such as form submissions, dialog interactions, and deletion or cancellation operations.
 */
export default {
  title: 'Components/Interaction/Button',
  component: Button,
  tags: ['autodocs'],
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      page: () => DocsTemplate('Button'), // don't forget adding this to new component documentation
      toc: {
        title: 'On this page',
        disable: false,
      },
    },
    layout: 'centered',
  },
  argTypes: {
    children: {
      control: 'object',
      description: 'Content of the button (text, HTML elements, etc.).',
      table: {
        type: { summary: 'ReactNode' },
      },
    },
    // others argTypes ...
  },
  args: {
    disabled: false,
    busy: false,
  },
} satisfies Meta<typeof Button>

type Story = StoryObj<typeof Button>

/**
 * This is the default button with only setting a **label** prop.
 */
export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    label: 'Default Button',
  },
}

// Others stories ...

```

This example includes a few helpful Storybook scripts:

- `pnpm dev`: Starts Storybook in dev mode with hot reloading at `localhost:6006`
- `pnpm build`: Builds the Storybook UI and generates the static HTML files
- `pnpm preview-storybook`: Starts a local server to view the generated Storybook UI

### Versioning & Publishing Packages

This example uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions, create changelogs, and publish to npm. It's preconfigured so you can start publishing packages immediately.

You'll need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` and add it to your GitHub repository settings to enable access to npm. It's also worth installing the [Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your repository.

### Generating the Changelog

To generate your changelog, run `pnpm changeset` locally:

1. **Which packages would you like to include?** ‚Äì This shows which packages and changed and which have remained the same. By default, no packages are included. Press `space` to select the packages you want to include in the `changeset`.
1. **Which packages should have a major bump?** ‚Äì Press `space` to select the packages you want to bump versions for.
1. If doing the first major version, confirm you want to release.
1. Write a summary for the changes.
1. Confirm the changeset looks as expected.
1. A new Markdown file will be created in the `changeset` folder with the summary and a list of the packages included.

### Releasing

When you push your code to GitHub, the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) will run the `release` script defined in the root `package.json`:

```bash
turbo run build --filter=docs^... && changeset publish
```

Turborepo runs the `build` script for all publishable packages (excluding docs) and publishes the packages to npm. By default, this example includes `@plume-ui-react` as the npm organization. To change this, do the following:

To publish packages to a private npm organization scope, **remove** the following from each of the `package.json`'s

```diff
- "publishConfig": {
-  "access": "public"
- },
```

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

`pnpm run build`
Build all apps and packages

`pnpm run dev`
Develop all apps and packages

`pnpm run lint`
Lint all apps and packages

Turborepo will cache locally by default. For an additional
speed boost, enable Remote Caching with Vercel by
entering the following command:

`pnpm dlx turbo login`

We suggest that you begin by typing:

```
cd plume-ui-react
pnpm dlx turbo login
```
