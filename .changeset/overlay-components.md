Adds `Modal` (with `ModalTrigger`, `ModalContent`, `ModalHeader`, `ModalBody`, `ModalFooter` and `ModalClose`): a dialog built with no dependencies. The focus moves into it, stays inside while the user tabs and goes back to the trigger on close, the page behind doesn't scroll, and `Esc` and a click on the backdrop close it, only on the one on top when they are nested. It can be controlled with `open` and `onOpenChange`, is named by its header or an `aria-label`, and its body takes the focus when it scrolls so a keyboard user can reach it.
