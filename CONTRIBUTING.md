4. Make your changes, following our coding conventions and guidelines.
5. Test your changes thoroughly.
6. Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.

### Commit Strategy

We follow a clear commit strategy to maintain an organized record of changes in our repository. Below are some common commit categories you can use:

- **fix**: Used for bug fixes.
   - Example: `fix: Resolve text overflow issue in the login button`.

Using a clear convention in commit messages helps contributors quickly understand the purpose of each change and makes Pull Request reviews smoother.

### Pull Request Guidelines

7. Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
8. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch of the original repository.

### Branching Model

We use a branching model to structure branches in our repository. Here's a suggested model based on commit categories:

- **main (or master)**: The main branch containing stable, production-ready code.

- **develop**: The primary development branch where features are integrated and continuous testing occurs.

- **feature/xxx**: Individual branches for new features or functionalities. 

  Example: `feature/user-authentication`

- **fix/xxx**: Branches for specific bug fixes.

  Example: `fix/navigation-menu`

- **docs/xxx**: Branches for documentation updates.

  Example: `docs/update-installation-guide`

- **perf/xxx**: Branches for performance improvements.

  Example: `perf/image-loading-optimization`

Following this structure, you can maintain an organized workflow for developing new features, fixing bugs, updating documentation, and enhancing performance in your Design System. It also facilitates collaboration among team members and keeps a clear record of project changes.
